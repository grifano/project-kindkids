      <h1>A Vision Turned into Reality</h1>
      <p>In 2024, we embarked on a heartfelt journey to bring hope and aid to children with disabilities in Ukraine. This mission began with a vision to make a tangible difference, and it came to life through our first charity event—an art-inspired charity dinner, held in the heart of Vancouver.</p>

      <h3>A Culinary Experience with Purpose</h3>
      <p>This elegant five-course dinner was a labor of love, prepared and curated with the invaluable help of my family, friends, and a passionate team of volunteers. The evening was elevated by thoughtfully paired wines, generously donated by <strong>Mount Boucherie Estate Winery</strong>, and expertly introduced by our on-site sommelier, <strong>Miles Kane</strong>. Each course and wine pairing was crafted to provide a fine dining experience with a purpose.</p>

      <h3>Generous Contributions from Our Sponsors</h3>
      <p>Our gratitude extends to <strong>Victor Steakhouse</strong> for their unwavering support. They lent us essential glassware and plates for the event, contributed sparkling wine for dessert, and donated a generous dining certificate, which was later auctioned to amplify our fundraising efforts.</p>
      
      <h3>Live Art and Exclusive Auctions</h3>
      <p>The event was graced by the presence of artist Maria Chernyi, who painted a stunning piece of art throughout the evening. Inspired by her Ukrainian heritage, Maria’s work became a centerpiece of our live auction, symbolizing the resilience and beauty of our cause. Alongside Maria’s masterpiece, we auctioned a unique photographic art piece, created and printed by our event photographer, Jenia Riashchenko.</p>

      <h3>The Power of Volunteers</h3>
      <p>This unforgettable evening would not have been possible without the dedication of my family—my mother, Tatiana Platonova, and my brother, Hlib Platonov, who worked tirelessly alongside me in the kitchen—and our incredible volunteers, including Christian Brown and others. Their support ensured that every detail was seamless, from the preparation of dishes to the smooth flow of the event.</p>
      
      <h3>Making a Direct Impact</h3>
      <p>Through the generosity and open hearts of our guests, we raised over $19,000 CAD. These funds were immediately put to use. I personally traveled to Ukraine, accompanied by my mother, Tatiana. Together, we purchased and delivered much-needed medications to children with disabilities, ensuring that every dollar made a direct and meaningful impact.</p>
